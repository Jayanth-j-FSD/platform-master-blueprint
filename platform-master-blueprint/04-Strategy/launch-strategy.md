# LAUNCH STRATEGY  
Unified Platform: Identity + Social + Marketplace + Collaboration + Payments  
Phased Rollout & Growth Blueprint

This document defines the full strategy for launching the platform from 0 → MVP → Private Beta → Public Launch → Scale.  
The launch MUST follow a **layered release sequence**, otherwise the platform will collapse under complexity.

---

# 1. CORE LAUNCH PRINCIPLES

1. **Do NOT launch all modules at once.**
2. **Start with the narrowest wedge possible.**
3. **Identity Layer must launch before anything else.**
4. **Build demand BEFORE building features.**
5. **Early users ≠ customers — they are testers.**
6. **Build network effects carefully — start small and dense.**
7. **Trust, safety, and payments readiness must be strong before public launch.**
8. **The first 1000 users matter more than the next 100,000.**

# 3. WEDGE ENTRY STRATEGY (THE MOST IMPORTANT PART)

You **must not** launch with all 5 layers.

Choose **one wedge** that becomes the entry point.

### Best wedges for your platform:

#### **Option A — Identity first (recommended)**
Start as:
- “Universal online identity”
- Strong verification
- Secure profile  
- Reputation score  
- Login provider for other apps

Examples: Google Identity, Apple ID, Telegram login.

#### **Option B — Social graph wedge**
Start as:
- Interest-based communities  
- Smart feed  
- Lightweight posting/sharing  
- Event/community hubs  

Examples: Twitter, Reddit, Discord.

#### **Option C — Marketplace wedge**
Start as:
- Local gig/freelancer marketplace  
- Creator services  
- Skills marketplace  
- Micro-job marketplace  

Examples: Fiverr, OLX, Upwork.

**Pick ONLY ONE wedge to start the flywheel.**

That wedge grows into the full 5-layer platform.
