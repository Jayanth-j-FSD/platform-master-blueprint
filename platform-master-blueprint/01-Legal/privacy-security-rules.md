# DO NOT REVEAL LIST  
High-Security Internal Confidentiality Document  
Access: Founders Only → Core Team (Need-to-Know Only)

This document lists all information that must **never be shared** with external people, investors (unless required), partners, contractors, or the public.

The goal is to protect:
- IP  
- Competitive advantage  
- Business model mechanics  
- Security systems  
- Internal algorithms  
- Legal + operational risks  

---

# 1. Core Architecture (STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL)
Do not reveal:
- Identity layer architecture  
- Trust graph structure & algorithms  
- Multi-layer platform architecture  
- Internal microservice boundaries  
- Security model & threat model  
- Rate-limiting rules  
- Internal API endpoints  
- Architecture diagrams  
- Database schemas  
- Permission system logic  
- Device trust calculation  
- Reputation/trust scoring formula  
- Data residency strategy  
- Internal infrastructure topology  
- Scaling and failover design  

These are the heart of your competitive moat.

---

# 2. Algorithms & Logic (NEVER REVEAL)
Never disclose:
- Ranking algorithms  
- Feed-ranking or discovery logic  
- Marketplace matching algorithms  
- Fraud detection systems  
- Credit/trust score algorithm  
- Payment routing logic  
- Escrow logic  
- Search ranking and scoring  
- Abuse detection and ban rules  
- Any ML/AI models used internally  

Competitors gain massive advantage if they obtain any of these.

---

# 3. Internal Infrastructure (RESTRICTED)
Do not reveal:
- Cloud provider structure  
- Kubernetes topology  
- Logging/monitoring tools  
- Internal dashboards  
- Git repo links  
- Server IP ranges  
- CI pipelines  
- Network diagrams  
- Secret management systems  
- Encryption key rotation rules  

If leaked, attackers get a map of your castle.

---

# 4. Admin-Level Tools & Panels (TOP SECRET)
Never disclose:
- Internal admin panel  
- Super-admin actions  
- Shadow-banning tools  
- Manual trust score override  
- Identity verification override  
- Transaction refund tools  
- Risk scoring dashboard  
- Suspicious activity logs  

These are extremely sensitive.

---

# 5. Business Strategy (CONFIDENTIAL)
Do not reveal:
- Feature roadmap  
- Release timeline  
- Rollout strategy  
- Growth loops  
- Internal metrics  
- Wedge entry plan  
- Fundraising strategy  
- Investor negotiation details  
- Pricing strategy  
- Go-to-market playbook  

These must be controlled tightly.

---

# 6. Data Models & User Graph (STRICT)
Never reveal:
- User graph linkage  
- Edge weights  
- Reputation parameters  
- Behavioral scoring system  
- Identity verification flags  
- API contract linking identity → social → marketplace → payments  

These define how the entire platform works.

---

# 7. Vendor & Partner Info (RESTRICTED)
Do not share:
- KYC provider  
- Payment processor names  
- Banking partners  
- Infrastructure vendors  
- Security vendors  
- AI model providers  

This protects negotiations and security.

---

# 8. Legal Documents (FOUNDER LEVEL)
Not public:
- Founder agreements  
- IP assignments  
- Board meeting notes  
- Internal policies  
- Security audits

These expose internal operations.

---

# 9. Internal Code Repositories (HIGH RISK)
Never share:
- GitHub private repos  
- Branch names  
- CI/CD tokens  
- API keys  
- Access tokens  
- Internal dependencies  
- Scripts, tools, migrations  

If repos leak, platform integrity collapses.

---

# 10. Payment Layer (TOP SECRET)
Do not reveal:
- Payment engine architecture  
- Wallet internal model  
- Fraud prevention rules  
- Anti-money-laundering logic  
- Settlement pipeline

- Payout logic  

This is financial infrastructure — highest risk.

---

# 11. Security Rules (STRICT)
Do not reveal:
- Rate limits  
- Firewall rules  
- Anti-bot logic  
- Suspicious behavior rules  
- Account lockout rules  
- Privileged access rules  
- Throttling logic  
- Secret rotation frequency  
- Encryption standards  

Attackers use these to bypass security.

---

# 12. Future Modules (INTERNAL ONLY)
Not to be shared:
- Planned upcoming features  
- New Layer expansions  
- AI integrations  
- Partner ecosystem plans  
- Developer platform details  
- Credit scoring system  
- Enterprise modules  

Revealing these helps competitors predict and counter.

---

# 13. Internal Communications (RESTRICTED)
Do not share:
- Slack/Teams messages  
- Emails with founders  
- Investor discussions

4. Logged and documented  

---

# 16. Consequences
Leaking ANY item from this list results in:
- Immediate removal  
- Legal action  
- Equity forfeiture (if applicable)  
- IP violation penalties  

This protects the company long-term.
