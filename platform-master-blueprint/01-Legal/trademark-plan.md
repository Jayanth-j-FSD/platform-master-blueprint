# TRADEMARKING PLAN

This document outlines the complete trademark protection strategy for the Company and its global unified platform, covering names, logos, domains, legal classes, filing stages, and long-term brand protection.

---

# 1. Purpose of the Trademark Plan

To protect the Company’s brand identity across:

- Platform name  
- Product names  
- Logo variants  
- Wordmarks  
- App store presence  
- Future expansions across identity, social, marketplace, collaboration, and payments layers  

The aim is to prevent competitors from copying or hijacking the brand.

---

# 2. Assets to Trademark

The Company must secure trademarks for:

### **2.1 Primary Brand Name (Wordmark)**
Example:  
**“PlatformName”**  
Covers usage across all platform elements.

### **2.2 Logo (Device Mark)**
Register all variants:
- Primary logo  
- Simplified/monochrome versions  
- App icon  

### **2.3 Taglines/Slogans**
If they become part of public branding.  
Example: “Your universal identity.”

### **2.4 Sub-brand Product Names**
If the platform uses modules:
- Identity Layer name  
- Marketplace name  
- Payments product (wallet, credits)  
- Collaboration suite name  
- Social engine name  

Registering sub-brands prevents others from using confusingly similar names.

# 3. Trademark Classes to File Under

The platform spans many technology, software, and digital service categories.  
File under the following **Nice Classification trademark classes**:

### **Primary Classes**

### **Optional Classes**

Registering across these ensures full protection for all modules of your unified platform.
